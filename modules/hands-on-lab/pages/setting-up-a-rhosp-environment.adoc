#  Setting up a RHOSP Environment

== Setting Up a RHOSP Environment

In this hands-on activity, you will learn how to set up a Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP) environment. This process involves installing and configuring the necessary components to create a functional RHOSP cloud.

### Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following:

1. A system with at least 16GB RAM (recommended 32GB).
2. Four virtual machines (or bare-metal servers) with the following specifications:
   - 4 CPUs each
   - 16GB RAM each
   - 100GB disk space each
3. A network connection between all systems.
4. A Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 8 server for the undercloud installation.
5. A user with sudo privileges on all systems.

### Step 1: Prepare the Undercloud

The undercloud is the control node that manages the overcloud (the actual OpenStack services). Begin by preparing your RHEL 8 server as the undercloud.

1. Register the undercloud server with Red Hat Subscription Manager:

   ```bash
   subscription-manager register --username <username> --password <password>
   ```

2. Attach the RHOSP subscription:

   ```bash
   subscription-manager attach --pool=<pool_id>
   ```

3. Install the necessary packages:

   ```bash
   sudo dnf install -y http://<your-rhel-server>/rhoso-install/el8/os/x86_64/openstack-16/os-collect-config
   ```

### Step 2: Install and Configure Director

The director is a component of the undercloud that manages the overcloud.

1. Install the director packages:

   ```bash
   sudo dnf install -y openstack-tripleo-puppet
   ```

2. Set up the director configuration:

   ```bash
   sudo openstack tripleo deploy --config-file /home/stack/templates/overcloud/config.yaml --output-dir /home/stack/templates/overcloud/ --timeout 120
   ```

3. Deploy the overcloud:

   ```bash
   sudo openstack overcloud deploy --templates --ntp-server 0.redhat.pool.ntp.org --network-file /home/stack/templates/overcloud/network/#  Setting up a RHOSP Environment
