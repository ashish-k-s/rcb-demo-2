#  Configuring Networking

## Configuring Networking in Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP)

### Overview

Networking is a fundamental aspect of Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP). It involves configuring various components to ensure seamless communication between different services and instances. This section will guide you through the process of configuring networking in RHOSP, focusing on key concepts and practical hands-on activities.

### Key Networking Components

1. **OpenStack Networking (Neutron):** Neutron is the core networking service in RHOSP. It provides a robust, scalable, and standards-based framework for network connectivity as a service.

2. **Network Types:** RHOSP supports multiple network types, including Flat, VLAN, VXLAN, and GRE. Each type has its unique characteristics and use cases.

3. **Subnets:** Subnets are IP networks created within the OpenStack environment. They are used to allocate IP addresses to instances.

4. **Routers:** Routers provide connectivity between different subnets, enabling instances to communicate with each other and with the external network.

5. **Security Groups:** Security groups act as firewalls for your instances, controlling inbound and outbound traffic at the instance level.

### Configuring Networking

#### Step 1: Create a Network

To create a new network, use the following command:

```bash
openstack network create --provider physical-network <network_name> --share
```

Replace `<network_name>` with the desired name for your network. The `--share` option makes the network available to all projects.

#### Step 2: Create a Subnet

Next, create a subnet within the newly created network:

```bash
openstack subnet create --network <network_name> --subnet-range <subnet_range> <subnet_name>
```

Replace `<network_name>` with the name of your network, `<subnet_range>` with the IP range for the subnet, and `<subnet_name>` with the desired name for the subnet.

#### Step 3: Create a Router

Create a router to manage traffic between different subnets:

```bash
openstack router create <router_name>
```

Replace `<router_name>` with the desired name for your router.

#### Step 4: Add Interfaces to the Router

4. **Routers:** Routers facilitate communication between different subnets and networks, enabling instances to communicate with external networks.

5. **Security Groups and Rules:** Security groups act as firewalls for your instances, controlling inbound and outbound traffic based on rules you define.
