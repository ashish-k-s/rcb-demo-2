== Explore RHOSP Networking Concepts

Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP) networking is a critical aspect of its functionality, enabling communication between various components and services. This section will delve into the fundamental networking concepts in RHOSP, including network types, segmentation, and load balancing.

### 1. Network Types

RHOSP supports multiple network types, each serving distinct purposes:

- **Provider Networks**: These networks are brought in from the underlying physical infrastructure and are typically used for access to external networks. They are often bridged directly to external networks using OVS (Open vSwitch).

- **Neutron Networks**: These are logical networks created and managed by the Neutron service. They can be further categorized into:

  - **Flat Network**: A simple network where all VMs on the same network can talk to each other without any isolation.
  
  - **VLAN Network**: A network that uses VLAN tags to provide isolation between VMs on the same broadcast domain.
  
  - **GRE/VXLAN Tunnels**: These networks use tunneling protocols to extend networks across IP infrastructure, providing scalability and flexibility.

### 2. Network Segmentation

Network segmentation in RHOSP is achieved through the use of projects (also known as tenants in previous OpenStack releases), users, and roles. This ensures that network resources are isolated and secure.

- **Projects**: Projects are logical containers for resources. Each project has its own set of users, roles, and network resources.

- **Users and Roles**: Users are assigned roles that define their level of access to resources within a project. This ensures that only authorized users can perform specific actions on network resources.

### 3. Load Balancing

Load balancing in RHOSP is facilitated by the Octavia service, which provides a robust, extensible, and highly available load balancing solution. Octavia supports various load balancing algorithms, including round robin, least connections, and source IP hash.

#### Hands-on Lab: Configuring Networking in RHOSP

**Objective**: To configure a basic network in RHOSP and understand its components.

**Steps**:

1. **Login to the RHOSP Dashboard**: Access the RHOSP dashboard using your credentials.

2. **Create a Network**: Navigate to "Project" -> "Networking" -> "Networks
