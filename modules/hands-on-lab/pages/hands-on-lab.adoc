#  Hands-on Lab

- **Hands-on Lab** is a practical, applied section of the Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP) training, designed to provide learners with real-world experience.
  - It involves **Setting up a RHOSP Environment**, guiding users through the process of deploying and initializing their own OpenStack cloud.
  - Additionally, it covers **Configuring Networking** in RHOSP, enabling learners to understand and manage network services such as routing, switching, and firewalls.
  - This lab is crucial for reinforcing the theoretical knowledge gained from understanding RHOSP architecture and components.
  - It offers a risk-free environment to practice installation and configuration tasks, ensuring learners are well-prepared to handle similar scenarios in a production setting.
  - The lab is structured to align with the overall training objectives, focusing on key areas like RHOSP networking concepts.
  - By the end of this lab, learners should be able to independently set up and configure a basic RHOSP environment, demonstrating a solid grasp of RHOSP's networking capabilities.
